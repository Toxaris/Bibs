Papers (sorted by citation key):

As citation key, please use the following three components:

 - last name of first author, in lowercase.
 - last two digits of year of publications.
 - first interesting word in title.

The first interesting word in the title is usually the first
verb, noun, adjective or adverb in the title.

If the year of publications is unknown, use an underscore.
